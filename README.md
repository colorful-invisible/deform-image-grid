A generative art project built with p5.js that allows you to interactively deform bitmap images on a grid by dragging handles.

## Description

This project creates a dynamic image display where bitmap images are arranged in a grid. You can deform the images by dragging the circular handles at the intersections of the grid lines. Images can be shuffled and uploaded.

## Features

- **Grid-based image deformation**: Drag handles to warp and distort images
- **12 built-in abstract images**: Pre-loaded colorful abstract artwork
- **Image shuffling**: Randomize the order of images in the grid
- **Batch image upload**: Select and upload multiple images at once
- **Image repetition**: Add the same image multiple times in sequence
- **Clear all images**: Remove all images to start fresh
- **Adjustable columns**: Change grid layout from 2-12 columns
- **Toggle handles**: Show/hide deformation handles for clean screenshots
- **High-res export**: Save snapshots as PNG files

## Usage

- **Drag handles**: Click and drag the pulsing circular handles to deform the image grid.
- **Toggle handles**: Press `H` to show/hide the deformation handles (perfect for clean screenshots).
- **Save snapshot**: Press `S` to save a high-resolution PNG image of the current deformation.
- **Open settings**: Click the gear icon to access the settings panel.

## Settings Panel

- **Shuffle Images**: Randomly reorder images in the grid
